<p>Here are the three sizes of the palette.

You can choose from everything we provide and put them into the palettes.<br>

Every small makeup pieces like eye shadow, and eye concealer powder will take one magnet space.<br>

Big pieces like shading powder and blush will take two magnets space. <br>

You can not only get the pallets, but you can also choose more makeup pieces. Therefore you can change what's in your pallet every day depending on what you feel like. <br>

You don't need any equipment to change the makeup pieces. The little holes in between the mirror and the makeup section is going to help you take the pieces off. The magnets that set in the pallets will help you put the pieces in. </p>

</ul></p>

<p>The costs are $10 for small, $20 for medium and $35 for the biggest size. If you choose bamboo for your packaging you need to add $5 for each. If you choose glass you need to add $3 for each. </p>

   <p>Julie's creator is Julie Ma, who came from China and currently stay in Canada. Like other girls, she has passion for makeup and the environment. (If you click the picture above you will get to her personal Instagram.)

She mentioned that her goal is to make every girl's life easier and the environment better. She encourages every girl can express their own understanding of fashion and seek their own beauty in a way that won't heart the earth.  

</p>
    <p>
She was influenced by the girls around her. When she was juniors, at the time she knew nothing about makeup, she already noticed that it's very difficult to meet the right one. Senior girls were always frustrating by putting on the right makeup, and most of the makeup brand is very bad to the environment. This was a blow for her.

So:), she decided to make something to be changed. Her dreams started from there.</p>
